# Motif Technical Challenge üê±‚Äçüíª

In our flagship product, Fabric, we use widgets to allow putting together highly customisable web pages. Your task is to develop a simple Visual Studio Console Application which simulates a vector-based widget package. Your application should support the following drawing objects (widgets):

1. Circle
2. Rectangle
3. Square
4. Textbox

The application should be able to store widgets in memory only (List) and print their coordinates with their shape and size (not their area, just their dimensions).
Coordinates are x and y integer values on an imaginary page.

The size/shape depends on the widget, as follows:
- circle ‚Äì diameter
- rectangle ‚Äì width and height
- square ‚Äì width
- textbox ‚Äì bounding rectangle (width and height)

NOTE:
- integer units are fine for all dimensions
- for the textbox you will also need to store the text to display, but don‚Äôt worry about font face /size / alignment, etc. 
- please use a separate .cs file for each class

Your console application should be able to 'print out' the current drawing by printing the key details of each widget (type, location, size/shape) to the console.

You DO NOT need to worry about any input from the user, you can use a hardcoded set of widgets to test the drawing simulator.

We have created the project with some code already added to help you get started quickly.

Also, don't forget to utilise inheritence and try to validate the data  when creating the widgets.

## Grading ‚úî
We will evaluate your exercise on your ability to follow requirements while demonstrating good programming practices, such as: Maintainability, Extensibility, Robustness to changing requirements, Testability and SOLID principles.


### Good luck!
